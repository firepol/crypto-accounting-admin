This project is the frontend part of crypto-accounting, a python program to retrieve all your crypto-history (balances, trades, deposits, withdrawals) on all the most popular (also some unpopular ones) exchanges. 

This frontend is based on the [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) framework. See [react-admin tutorial](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Tutorial.html) to understand how it works, in particular check also [create and edit actions](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Tutorial.html#adding-creation-and-editing-capabilities) for CRUD operations.

For this frontend to work, you must run the `backend.py` script. Refer to the other project documentation to make the backend work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs all the needed NPM packages to run the application.

### `yarn react-scripts start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn react-scripts build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
